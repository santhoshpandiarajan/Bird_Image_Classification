# Bird-Classifier
It is a python project to classify birds. #SubashPalvel #subashpalvel #subash #palvel #SUBASHPALVEL


This time, our aim is to categorise various bird species. For those working in the forest departments, who
spend their days studying various species of flora and fauna, these kinds of issues are crucial. Now, it is
exceedingly challenging for humans to see and identify the species a bird belongs to, especially when
dealing with extremely uncommon birds. Here, our approach assists in identifying the bird species by
utilising image classification algorithms trained on a dataset of 500 different bird species. 2500 test
images, 2500 validation images, and 80,085 training images. To acquire the most accurate results from
the data we gathered, the model is trained with 50 epoches. The outcomes of our training this model using
different compilers are as follows. The configuration of the local machine we trained on includes Ryzen
550U and 8GB RAM.

As can be seen from the comparison above, training a model on a local machine requires a lot of time, making it impossible for a student to complete. Nevertheless, by using cloud compilers like Google Colab and Intel OneApi, we substantially cut the time, making it easier and more accessible for students to learn AI and ML.
